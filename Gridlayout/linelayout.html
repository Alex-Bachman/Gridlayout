    <h1>Line Based Grid Layout</h1>
    <div class="Linebasedgrid">
        <div class="grid-item-1">On This page I used a div class to apply the table functionalty to each individual
            block</div>
        <div class="grid-item-2">From there I was able to figure out what to put in the style sheet</div>
        <div class="grid-item-3">I needed to create an element class, and use that to make the grid using display: grid;
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item-4">Once the class was established it was easy to do what was necessary with the background
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item-5">I added different colors to each box and background</div>
        <div class="grid-item-6">The one thing I didn't do was position the grid anywhere on the website</div>
